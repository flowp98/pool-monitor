# pool-monitor

This is a web UI to easily have a real time view on your mining device. Built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and AngularJS for the front end and PHP for the back end.

## Setup

You just need your API Key that you can find in My Account > Edit Account on the Suprnova web UI, or your wallet address. It will show you the hashrate, the balance and the gain on live. For suprnova users, workers too. Choose what you mine (Complete name or abbreviation work, like verge or xvg). You have the price on live too.

## Options

You can save the API key (it's only saved on your computer in a cookie), choose the theme which could be clear or dark for the night demons ;)
